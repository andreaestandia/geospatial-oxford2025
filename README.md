The objective of this assignment is to work with species distributions and environmental data in R. You will learn how to download species locality data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, GBIF (https://www.gbif.org), and environmental data from Worldclim https://www.worldclim.org) and plot them on a map. You will then run models to predict the distribution of the species based on climatic variables. Finally, you will use your model to predict the distribution of the species 70 years from now.

We provide an Quarto file with code, a setup script,ÃŸ and instructions for the assignment. The practical is self-contained and provides all the information you need then to tackle the assignment described below for the assessed coursework.

The R script for the practical is here: https://canvas.ox.ac.uk/courses/273641/modules#module_452047

Work through this and make sure you understand all the steps, ask a demonstrator if you have any questions. Then you are ready to tackle the assignment.
